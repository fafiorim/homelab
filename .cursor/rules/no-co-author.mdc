# Commits: no Co-authored-by

- **Never** add `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>` (or any Cursor co-author) to commit messages.
- **Never** use `git commit --trailer "Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>"` or similar.
- When committing in this repo, use plain `git commit -m "message"` with no co-author trailer.
