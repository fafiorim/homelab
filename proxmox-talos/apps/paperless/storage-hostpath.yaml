# Storage configuration using hostPath
# Storage is mounted from Proxmox at /var/mnt/paperless on worker nodes
# which maps to: /mnt/pve/Ugreen_NFS_VM/containers/paperless on Proxmox
#
# Note: This requires:
# 1. Proxmox mp0 mount configured on worker VMs
# 2. Talos kubelet extraMounts configured (done in worker-XX-patch.yaml)
---
# No PersistentVolumes or PersistentVolumeClaims needed
# Volumes are defined directly in deployments using hostPath
